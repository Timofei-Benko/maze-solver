# Maze solver

This is a function, that accepts a maze and a starting position, and returns coordinates to the exit, or, if there are none, returns null.

It's a realization of Depth First Search algorythm.

If you want to see it in action, you can clone this repo and run `node mazeSolver.js` in your console, or run `index.html` file in your browser and see the output in your DevTools console. 

The code is provided commentaries for each logical step, so that you could understand my reasoning better.
